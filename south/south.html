                <h2> Historical Background</h2>
                Debbane Palace is an 18th-century building in Saida, built by Ali Hammoud in 1721.
                The palace features typical diwans (Oriental-style living rooms), a long narrow-front hallway,
                several rooms, and an open-air courtyard with decorative brown and white stripes of stone and intricate mosaic
                tiles typical of the Ottoman period.ef Debbane bought the house in 1800, and the family 
                lived there for generations. After moving into the building, he built another level to accommodate the 
                family. However, in 1978 the Debbane family was forced to leave their home due to the Lebanese Civil War. Then in 1982, Israel’s 
                attacked Lebanon, bombarding the Debbane Palace’s area. The house was almost destroyed when the Debbane family returned after the War.
                The restoration process, which began in 2000, brought life to the home and today receives over 2,000 visitors from around the world each year.
                One of the most significant bathhouses in the ancient city of Saida is the Hammam Al-Jadeed, built-in 1720. This hammam was boarded up and crumbled
                 for over 70 years until Said Bacho, Founder and Chairman of Sharqy Foundation for Cultural Development acquired the building in 2008. Today, 
                 the hammam hosts an art exhibition to bring life back into this beautiful site.
                 One of Lebanon’s beautiful jewels is the city of Jezzine in South Lebanon. Surrounded by mountain peaks and pine forests, it promises visitors stunning scenery,
                 beautiful weather, and fantastic food.
                 Jezzine is famous for its handcrafted knives that take the form of a phoenix. It is also known for the stunning waterfall.
