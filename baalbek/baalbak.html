                <h2> Historical Background</h2>
                    Though they are mere ruins, these temples attract visitors and arouse their admiration. In 1898, a German archeological expedition was the first 
                    to undergo excavation and repair works. In 1922, archeological researchers and French architects continued to excavate; and after the Independence (1943),
                    the General Directorate of Antiquities in Lebanon undertook the responsibility of 
                    supervising those works.The construction of the temples dates back to the end of the 3rd millennium B.C.The date is not clearly stated; most probably
                    it is the 1st millennium B.C. The site was a place of worship on a mound with an altar inside 
                    a gallery surrounded by a wall, as mentioned in the Semitic historical writings and in the Bible.During the Hellenistic period (333 – 64B.C.),rituals changed and Sun worship was the main cult.
                    Thus the city was known as "Heliopolis" (the City of the Sun) like the greatest Egyptian metropolis. The old gallery was enlarged, and at the eastern side a huge podium was erected in order to
                    become the base of the temple. However, the temple 
                    was not constructed and the presence of some huge stones is a testament to this Hellenistic project. The construction of the temple began during Augustus' reign and at the end of Nero's reign
                    (37 – 68A.D.) and was completed in the 3rd century A.D.
                    The great gallery was constructed during the 2nd century.
